## Create an engine 



--mountable ==> rails plugin new generator is used to generate engine scaffolds.

--full ---> all the models, controllers, helpers, and routes are available to the host application
--mountable --> all the models, controllers, helpers, and routes are not available to the host application by DEFAULT

thus using `--mountable` we are isolating engine functionality from the host application




The app model we love 

└── FleetPanda App/
    └── app/
        ├── models/
        │   └── application_record.rb
        ├── controllers/
        │   └── application_controller.rb
        ├── jobs/
        │   └── application_job.rb
        ├── mailers/
        │   └── application_mailer.rb
        ├── views/
        │   └── layouts/
        │       └── application.html.erb
        └── [...]


Let's suppose we keep on adding features inside this codebase and now we want two more features so the codebase looks something like this 

.
└── FleetPanda App/
    └── app/

        ├── controllers/
        │   ├── application_controller.rb
        │   ├── authentication/
        │   │   └── session_controller.rb
        │   ├── orders/
        │   │   └── [...]
        │   ├── assets /

        │   ├── new_feature_1/
        │   │   └── [...]
        │   └── new_feature_2/
        │       └── [...]

        │   └── [...]
        ├── views/

        │       ├── application.html.erb
        │       └── [...]
        └── [...]

#### Steps to Buiild a rails engine for the host application 
1. `rails plugin new blog --mountable` instead of --full
    --mountable : using it all the models, controllers, helpers, and routes are `not available` to the host application by DEFAULT and we segregate the engine here 

    `    1.1. the command creates rails engine inside host application 
          -engine
            - app
              - model 
              - view 
              - controller
              - jobs
              - mailers 
            - lib
            - config
            - test 
`

2. Inside lib/engine_name/engine.rb
   -- explain why isolate_namespace is used 
      --The isolate_namespace method is responsible for isolating the controllers, models, routes, and other things into their own namespace, away from similar components inside the application.
       ensuring no engine's components could "leak" into the application, causing unwanted disruption, 
      or that important engine components could be overridden by similarly named things within the application.
3.
